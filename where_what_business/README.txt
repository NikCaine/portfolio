This project was my final for the IBM Professional Certification in Data Science course.

We had to use Foursquare's Places API.

The project analyses data from the United States Census Bureau, Foursquare, and ArcGIS (a geocoder used via the geopy library)
to recommend both the location and type of restaurant to open in a specific region. The example in the notebook analyses the
Pacific Northwest region of the US and recommends several locations within several metros to open recommended restaurant types.
